To Control the snake during normal play use keys : W A S D || Left Arrow, Right arrow, Up arrow, Down arrow.

You have some functionality that you can adjust within the inspector.  Locate the "Snake" game object, and click on it's child. 
Time to Move will adjust how often the snake does a move action.
Time scale multiplier will increase the time scale. Be careful to use this during normal play. I only added it for debugging purpose on the pathfinder. 

To play just start the game and chose which game mode you'd like in the start menu.
